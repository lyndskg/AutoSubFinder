# AutoSubFinder

AutoSubFinder is an innovative coding project that aims to automatically find and download subtitle track files for movies and other videos. The project utilizes web scraping and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to search various subtitle databases and provide accurate and synchronized subtitle tracks for videos.

## Key Features:
1. Web Scraping: Develop a web scraping module to search popular subtitle databases and websites for subtitle track files related to the given video.
2. Video Identification: Implement video identification algorithms to match the video with its corresponding subtitle track using metadata or video fingerprints.
3. Multilingual Support: Support multiple languages for subtitle track retrieval, catering to a diverse global audience.
4. Synchronization: Ensure that the downloaded subtitle track files are accurately synchronized with the video's audio for seamless viewing.
5. Quality Control: Implement mechanisms to verify the quality and accuracy of the downloaded subtitle tracks, filtering out poor or incorrect subtitle files.
6. Batch Processing: Allow users to search for subtitle tracks for multiple videos simultaneously for convenience.
7. User Interface: Develop an easy-to-use user interface where users can upload videos and access the downloaded subtitle tracks.
8. Subtitle Format Conversion: Support the conversion of subtitle files into different formats compatible with various video players.


## Best Coding Languages:
Python is a versatile language and is well-suited for web scraping and NLP tasks. You can use libraries like BeautifulSoup for web scraping and NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for NLP functionalities.

## Basic Workflow:
1. Video Metadata Extraction: Extract metadata from the uploaded video to aid in the subtitle track search process.
2. Web Scraping: Use web scraping techniques to search popular subtitle databases and websites for matching subtitle track files.
3. Subtitle Track Download: Download the identified subtitle track files and save them in a suitable format.
4. Synchronization: Implement algorithms to synchronize the downloaded subtitle tracks with the video's audio.
5. Quality Control: Implement checks to ensure the quality and accuracy of the downloaded subtitle tracks.
6. Batch Processing: Allow users to search for subtitle tracks for multiple videos simultaneously to save time.
7. Subtitle Format Conversion: Support the conversion of subtitle files into different formats to cater to various video players.
8. User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface for video upload, subtitle track search, and download.


AutoSubFinder aims to make the process of finding and downloading subtitle tracks hassle-free, enhancing the viewing experience for users who prefer or require subtitles for their videos.
